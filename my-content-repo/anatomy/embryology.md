# Embryology: Early Human Development

Welcome to the Embryology content page! Here you will find notes and resources on the fascinating process of human development from conception to birth.

## Key Concepts:

* **Gametes and Fertilization:**
    * Spermatogenesis and Oogenesis.
    * The process of fertilization and zygote formation.

* **Early Embryonic Development:**
    * Cleavage and blastulation.
    * Formation of the blastocyst (inner cell mass and trophoblast).
    * Implantation.

* **Gastrulation:**
    * Formation of the three germ layers: Ectoderm, Mesoderm, and Endoderm.
    * Significance of germ layers in tissue and organ formation.

* **Neurulation:**
    * Development of the neural tube and central nervous system.
    * Neural crest cell derivatives.

* **Fetal Period:**
    * Growth and maturation of organs and systems.
    * Key milestones of development during the fetal period.

## Clinical Correlations:

Many congenital anomalies arise from disruptions during embryonic development. Understanding the normal process is crucial for identifying the origins of birth defects.

* **Neural Tube Defects:** e.g., Spina bifida, Anencephaly.
* **Heart Defects:** Malformations during cardiac looping and septation.
* **Limb Defects:** Issues during limb bud development.
